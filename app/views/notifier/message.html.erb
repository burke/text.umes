Hey <%= @book.seller %>,

<%= @buyer %> just left you a message about your book "<%= @book.title %>" on the UMES Textbook Exchange. Here's what they wrote:

======================================================================
<%= @message %>
======================================================================

Once you've sold the book, make sure you remove it from the listings so you quit getting emails about it. To do that, click the link below:

<%= @book.removal_link %>

You should probably reply to <%= @buyer %>@cc.umanitoba.ca now, but make sure you don't include the removal link in your reply!

Thanks!
